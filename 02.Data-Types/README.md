# Data Types
It refers to what type of data a variable will store. 

Python dynamically assign data types to its variable on the basis of values that is assigned to it. Following are some data types that Python supports.

- **Boolean** - has two possible values, True or False.
- **Integer (int)** types - for storage of integer values.
- **Floating (float)** point types - for storage of decimal numbers
- **String (str)** type used to store strings in memory.

**NOTE: PYTHON DOES NOT SUPPORT CHARACTER TYPES (CHAR) BUT MOST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES DO e.g Java**
