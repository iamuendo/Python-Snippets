# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
## Definition
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions & logic. 

## Key Components of OOP
### 1. Class
A class is a user-defined type that describes what a certain type of object will look like.

Commonly compared to a blueprint.

### 2. Object
Object is an entity that has state & behavior.
It consists of methods & properties to make a particular type of data useful.

### 3. Method (behavior)
A method is a function defined inside a class, that describes the behaviors of an object.

**NOTE** : In Python, Methods **MUST** have atleast one parameter otherwise it will result to an error. Self is the default parameter.

### 4. Attribute
An attribute is a changeable property or characteristic of some component of a program that can be set to different values.

It represent the state of an object.

In Python, it is accessed via the dot notation.

For example:

```
```
## OOP techniques you should apply on your code
1. Using Constructors
2. Using the Assert keyword

## Principles of OOP
### 1. Inheritance

### 2. Polymorphism

### 3. Encapsulation

### 4. Abstraction
