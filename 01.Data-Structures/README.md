# VARIABLES & IDENTIFIERS
## Variables 
Variables are the storage spaces to store texts or numbers. 

In python you don’t need to assign data types to a variable. 

Python dynamically assign data type to every variable on the basis of value assigned to it.

For Example:

```
num = 1 
```

This will assign an integer type to variable who’s name is num.

## Identifiers
Identifiers are the names given to variables or functions etc. 

#### NOTE: You should observe these rules (syntax) when creating identifiers:

- Reserved words (keywords) cannot be used as identifiers.

- User-defined identifiers can consist of letters, digits, underscores, and the dollar-sign $

- Must start with a with a letter

- Identifiers are case sensitive (count & Count are different variables)

- An identifier can be as long you like provided it makes sense to you and other developers.
